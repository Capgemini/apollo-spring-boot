# apollo-spring-boot
Some Gradle tasks to get you going:
* '''run''' - run the app locally (on your machine). Open '''http://localhost:8080/greeting/YourName''' to get a greeting (all the other standard Spring Boot stuff is there on the standard URIs)
* '''buildDocker''' - builds a Docker image of the project (you need Docker installed and running for this to work)
